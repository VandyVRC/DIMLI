Digital Media Management Library project

Creator: Matthew Isner, Vanderbilt University

A web-based application for the cataloging of cultural objects, developed specifically for use by Visual Resources professionals, which manages workflow and facilitates a singularly rich cataloging experience and powerful data exports.

USE NOTE: This software will NOT currently function properly if ported to another server environment AS IS - it still contains too many configuration settings. I am in the process of reorganzing and creating new configuration files that will enable DIMLI to be installed on other Apache-like environments. Documentation will come, but in the meantime your mileage will vary.

in progress..
