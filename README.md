DIMLI

Digital Media Management Library

Created by Matthew Isner, Vanderbilt University

Project Description
-------------------

A web-based application for the cataloging of cultural objects, developed specifically for use by Visual Resources professionals, which manages workflow and facilitates a singularly rich cataloging experience and powerful data exports.

DIMLI is currently used by the Visual Resources Center and the Department of History of Art at Vanderbilt University to process and deliver new digitization orders, and also to perform a recataloging of thousands of old image records in order to conform with the Visual Resources Association's Core 4 standards for the cataloging of cultural objects.

DIMLI has facilitated our massive recataloging endeavor by allowing us to establish Work and Image record relationships where before we had none, and by introducing an order management system that enables us to more easily assign and track workflow tasks.

State of the Project
--------------------

>WARNING: At this time, I do not suggest attempting to install this application on your server environment. 

I am in the process of phasing out several aspects of the app that tie it specifically to our server environment, as well as some soon-to-be-deprecated PHP functions. Please check back for updates as I prepare the app for distribution; but in the meantime, feel free to poke around.

Add These to Your Installation
------------------------------

>_php/_config/constants.inc.php

I will provide a template for this file in the near future. It contains constant definitions which need to be completed for your specific database environment.
